## Upstart

**Who you are:** Beginners, just getting started.  

**Your focus:**

- Train in the gym until you reach **2,000 total battle stats (TBS)**.  
  - A good goal is around **500 in each stat**.  
- Avoid fighting at random. No mugging or attacking strangers unless it is for a mission.  
- Put all your energy into the gym since this is the fastest way to grow.  
- Ask questions in faction chat, check the forum guides, and read the faction wiki whenever you need help.

## Grifter

**Who you are:** Upstarts who hit 2,000 TBS.  

**Your focus:**

- Level up to **15 as fast as possible** by attacking targets from **Baldr’s List** or other leveling lists.  
- Hold off on training for now and concentrate on attacking to gain levels quickly.  
- You unlock the faction’s **weapon and armor depot**, which lets you borrow strong equipment.  
- Join in our **chaining events** where we work together to grow and help Grifters level faster.

## Outlaw

**Who you are:** Grifters who reached **level 15**.  

**Your focus:**

- Go back to **training** as your main priority.  
- Use flights to make money for yourself and to fund happy jumps, which help your stats grow much faster.  
- Take part in faction wars, which we try to run every other week, and join chaining events.  
- Stay prepared and geared up since Outlaws are the backbone of the faction’s fighting force.

## Bigger Picture

- **Wars:** We aim to run wars every other week.  
- **Chains:** Regular chaining events help everyone progress together.  
  - They are key for Grifters to reach level 15 quickly.  
  - They also give the faction the [respect](glossary.html#respect) needed to unlock new perks and improvements for the deposit.  
- **Community:** Never hesitate to ask for help. Before level 15, money is not that important, so do not stress about it. Focus on your role’s goals and the rest will come with time.
